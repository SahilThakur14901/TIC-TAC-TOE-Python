# TIC-TAC-TOE-Python
My first project using Python on Jupyter Notebooks. Very basic concepts have been implemented in this code like functions, loops and nested statements.

This code takes the user input to assign markers to them, randomly return which player will go first, takes input from user to place the marker in the desired position if it is free, checks after each turn whether the user has won, or if the board is full and no one has won yet, declares the game as a tie. The display_board() fn makes use of the IPython.display module to import clear_output, so that older outputs are not displayed whenever the board is updated. As I keep learning new concepts, I'll keep making changes in this code to make it more presentable and user friendly.
